        <h3>Arrests for Marijuana Possession by state</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left; max-width: 1600px;">As the United States begins to decriminalize marijuana possession, a major new industry has emerged. Still, there remains a fundamental injustice suffered by those with non-lethal marijuana possession convictions. Ideally, I would have liked to analyze state incarceration numbers, but I was only able to collect state arrest records.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This database shows marijuana-related arrest offense counts in the United States by state for the year 2020.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">While it makes sense for some of these states, like Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina to have high arrest rates due to their marijuana legality statuses, it is concerning to see such high arrest numbers for states like Texas, New Jersey, and New York, where marijuana is either legal or decriminalized.</p>

            <p>Marijuana is still considered to be a Schedule 1 controlled substance on the Federal level. That puts it in the same category as heroin. And yet, as states begin to pass legislature legalizing cannabis, early legalizers have made over $1 billion in tax revenue from the industry already.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the global pandemic, when the nation attempted a quarantine and civilians were asked to stay home and practice social distancing, marijuana dispensaries were deemed to be an essential business in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and D.C. In other states, however, you could still be arrested for buying or selling pot.</p>
            <p>Explore below to learn more about how much money states made from marijuana-related taxes, and how much money could be made in states who have yet to legalize the substance.</p>

            <p>However, in the end, it’s not really about the money. It’s about social justice and ethics. Studies show that a disproportionate amount of the enforcement and arrests is concentrated on communities of color. In fact, black people are nearly four times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession, and arresting nonviolent marijuana offenders has been a huge player in the U.S.’s history of mass incarceration.</p>
            <p>The right thing for the U.S. government to do is to legalize marijuana, regulate it, treat it like a normal industry, and drop the charges on anyone that has been convicted of a non-violent marijuana-related crime.</p>
            <p>But what can we do to help?</p>
