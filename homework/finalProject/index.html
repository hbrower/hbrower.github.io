            This project will highlight the hypocrisy of states profiting off of the marijuana industry while people are still incarcerated on nonviolent marijuana-related charges.

              <p>Hi Hannah—</p>
  
              <p>While many people do cite us as the originator of the 40,000 number — it actually stems from analysis done at NORML and is likely derived from a <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/dudsfp04.pdf">2007 Bureau of Justice Statistics report</a> that (a) breaks out incarcerated populations by substance-specific drug offenses and then (b) applies those proportions to state and federal prison populations. However, this number is (a) old and (b) does not include the number of people serving shorter, drug-related sentences in local jails (there were 182,000 of those people confined in 2011, though we don't have the breakdown by substances). Nor does that number include the vast majority of the 758,000 people arrested for marijuana offenses that year.</p> 
              
              <p>That said, we believe that even if this calculation were done using a more recent BJS report, it would still dramatically undercount the number of people currently incarcerated due to cannabis-related charges. Reasons below.</p> 
              <ul>
                  <li>This extrapolation fails to fully account for the following as these populations are often the most difficult to get accurate reporting data from:
              
              <br>- People incarcerated in local & county jails — a significant number, given that there were 545,602 arrests for cannabis in 2019. A great primer from contextualizing this can be found <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/10/12/us-disastrous-toll-criminalizing-drug-use">here</a>. 
              
              <br>- Individuals currently incarcerated in our country's (1,700+) juvenile correctional facilities, Indian county jails, immigration detention centers, etc.
              
              <br>- Individuals incarcerated <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html">pre-trial & pre-sentencing</a>. 
              
              <br>- Individuals on supervised release who have been re-incarcerated due to a marijuana-related technical parole / probation violation. 
              
              <br>- We know that personal drug use for individuals on supervised release (and we know those drug-related violations are disproportionately marijuana-related, especially in cities, source, source,) is one of the largest drivers of mass incarceration.</li>
              
             <li>Furthermore, as BJS itself acknowledges — their criminal justice statistics are subject to under and/or misreporting for other reasons, including but not limited to; 
              
              <br>- The implications of different record-keeping requirements across local, state, federal, and tribal systems, record loss/destruction, dirty data, etc.
              
              <br>- Reporting offenses by the most serious offense category means that someone who was incarcerated for a marijuana offense may not be reported as such.
              
              <br>- For instance, someone selling marijuana who has a firearm in their home may be reported as a weapons offense rather than a drug offense.
              
              <br>- Don’t even get us started on the nexus between marijuana and immigration-related violations.</li>
              
              <li>Furthermore, an incarcerated individual who was charged with multiple offenses after a marijuana-related arrest may have technically served the sentence of the marijuana offense, and thus is not captured in the data.</li> 
              
              <p>All that to say, for many complicated reasons (many—though not all—of them stemming from our country's  byzantine approach to criminal justice record-keeping), we cannot provide an exact number of people incarcerated for cannabis. And unfortunately, we have yet to see any other nonprofit or governmental report that does that.</p>
              
              <p>Wish we could be more helpful.  Good luck with your project!</p>
